/ crush on mobile -- problem is in matrix.js. 
  In init_size(), when the screen width (_w) is too small
  Math.floor(_w / (char_w * 12)) will return 0 which makes
  _columns 0. That leads to _rows being divided by 0.

- remove all references to query_* in views/head & static/js/matrix.js
- further refine font_size breakpoints for screen widths in matrix.js
- clean up refs to now.n-y-c.org/now and only point to /now
  then clean up server config and remove now.n-y-c.org which is likely rediundant
/ stop animation when accessibility menu selected
  (currently a hack, should be better)
- integrate relative 10 pitch font
